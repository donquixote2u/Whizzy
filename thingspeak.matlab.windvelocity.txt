% Read wind speed and direction from a ThingSpeak channel and visualize
% wind velocity using the MATLAB COMPASS plot function.

% Channel 12397 contains data from the MathWorks Weather Station, located
% in Natick, Massachusetts. The data is collected once every minute. Field
% 1 contains wind direction data and field 2 contains wind speed data.

% Channel ID to read data from
readChannelID = 12397;
% Wind Direction Field ID
WindDirFieldID = 1;
% Wind Speed Field ID
WindSpeedFieldID = 2;

% Channel Read API Key 
% If your channel is private, then enter the read API
% Key between the '' below: 
readAPIKey = '';

% Fetch wind direction for the last 60 minutes from the MathWorks weather
% station. Learn more about the THINGSPEAKREAD function by going to
% the Documentation tab on the right side pane of this page.

windDir = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID, 'Fields', WindDirFieldID, 'NumMinutes', 60, 'ReadKey', readAPIKey);

% Fetch wind speed for the last 60 minutes from the MathWorks weather station
windSpeed = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID, 'Fields', WindSpeedFieldID, 'NumMinutes', 60, 'ReadKey', readAPIKey);

% Convert to radians
rad = windDir*2*pi/360;

% Add 90 counter clockwise rotation to align the compass with true North
rad = rad+pi/2;
% Calculate the cosine component
u = cos(rad) .* windSpeed; % x coordinate of wind speed on circular plot

% Calculate the sine component
v = sin(rad) .* windSpeed; % y coordinate of wind speed on circular plot

% Generate a compass plot
compass(u,v);
